## Implementing a JSON Parser with Regular Expressions

### Understanding JSON Syntax
I revisited the JSON syntax to ensure a solid understanding of its structure, including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null values. This foundational understanding was crucial for designing the parsing logic.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Handling Nested Structures**: Dealing with nested objects and arrays required careful consideration to ensure the parser could handle complex JSON data structures correctly.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling for various syntax errors, such as missing colons, unexpected tokens, or incomplete JSON strings
- **Optimizing Regular Expressions**: Crafting efficient regular expressions to accurately tokenize different JSON elements to avoiding overlapping matches was a significant challenge.

### Addressing Challenges
- **Modular Design**: Breaking down the parsing process into smaller, modular functions helped manage complexity and allowed for easier debugging and maintenance.
- **Iterative Development**: Adopting an iterative approach to development, where I implemented and tested small features incrementally, allowed me to tackle challenges methodically and gradually build up the parser's functionality.

In conclusion, implementing a JSON parser with regular expressions was a valuable learning experience. Despite the challenges encountered, the process helped understanding of JSON syntax and parsing principles.
